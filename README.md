One of the classic games that you can create with web development is tic-tac-toe. This game 
involves two players who take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid, trying to form a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal line of their own symbols. To build a tic-tac-toe web application, you need
to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML defines the structure and content of the web page, such as 
the grid, the buttons, and the score. CSS styles the elements of the web page, such as the colors, 
fonts, and borders. JavaScript adds interactivity and logic to the web page, such as handling user 
clicks, updating the game state, and checking for winning conditions. By combining these technologies
and functionalities, you can create a fun and dynamic tic-tac-toe game that users can enjoy playing 
against each other or against an AI opponent.
